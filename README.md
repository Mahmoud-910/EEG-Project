🔍 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. Memory Error during Preprocessing

python
# Solution: Process subjects in batches
for batch in range(0, 109, 20):
    process_subjects(start=batch, end=min(batch+20, 109))
2. GPU Out of Memory

python
# Reduce batch size in config
BATCH_SIZE = 16  # Instead of 32
3. MNE Installation Issues

bash
# Try conda installation
conda install -c conda-forge mne
4. Slow Training

python
# Use mixed precision training
from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import set_global_policy
set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
5. Low Accuracy

Check data preprocessing (filtering, normalization)
Verify epoch extraction aligns with task events
Try different hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout)
Ensure sufficient training epochs
